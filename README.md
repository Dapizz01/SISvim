Installation for the current user: Download the repo and move all the directories in ~/.vim/ (create the directory if it doesn't exist).
Installation for all users: Download the repo, go in /usr/share/vim/vimX/ (X = version of Vim installed) and copy/paste the blif.vim files in the directories.
Also make sure to include "syntax on" in the .vimrc file (create it if it doesn't exist).
