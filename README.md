# SISvim
Syntax Highlighting (+ snippets) of SIS language for Vim

# Installation (Unix)
If you want to install the snippets, it's mandatory to also install UltiSnips (https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) and recommended to install YouCompleteMe (https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe).

Installation for the current user: Download the repo and move all the directories in ~/.vim/ (create the directory if it doesn't exist).

Installation for all users (without snippets): Download the repo, go in /usr/share/vim/vimX/ (X = version of Vim installed) and copy/paste the blif.vim files in the directories.

Also make sure to include "syntax on" in the .vimrc file (create it if it doesn't exist).
